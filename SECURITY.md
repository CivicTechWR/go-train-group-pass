## Reporting a Vulnerability

Found a security issue? Please let us know right away:

1. Email the maintainers at [security@civictechwr.org](mailto:security@civictechwr.org) and include “GO Train Group Pass” in the subject line.
2. Provide as much detail as possible—affected endpoints, reproduction steps, logs, or proof-of-concept code.
3. Avoid opening a public GitHub issue until we confirm a fix or mitigation plan.

We aim to acknowledge reports within **3 business days** and will keep you updated as we investigate and remediate the issue. When appropriate, we will credit reporters in release notes or the project changelog.

Thank you for helping keep CivicTechWR projects secure!
