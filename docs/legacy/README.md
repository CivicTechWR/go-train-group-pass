# Legacy Documentation

The files in this directory capture planning notes and migration guides from the early CivicTechWR pilot. They remain available for historical reference but are not required for day-to-day development.

- `README_CIVICTECHWR.md` – Original CivicTechWR project overview.
- `README_MCP.md` – Mission Control Program documentation from the initial R&D sprint.
- `MIGRATION_TO_CIVICTECHWR.md` – Notes on the hand-off to the CivicTechWR instance.
- `CIVICTECHWR_MIGRATION_READY.md` – Pre-launch checklist used during Week 2 validation.
- `SETUP_WEEK2.md`, `WEEK2_DELIVERABLES.md`, `WEEK2_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` – Week 2 implementation plan and deliverables.

If you need to revive any of this material for future migrations, use it as a template, but keep current onboarding docs in the repository root or `docs/`.
