## 🌱 A Guide to Collaborative Coding with AI

As a volunteer team at Civic Tech WR, we're all here to build things that help our community. We also want this to be a place where we can learn, trust each other, and work together well.

AI tools are a fantastic resource that can help us be more productive and learn new concepts. This guide outlines how we can use them effectively while supporting each other and our project's goals.

### Honoring Our Shared Time

We all contribute on a volunteer basis, and we want to make the most of everyone's time.

When a teammate reviews a Pull Request (PR), it's much easier for them if the code is already tested and follows our project's style. It can be confusing and time-consuming to review code that's unfamiliar or doesn't seem to work.

A great way to support your teammates is to treat all code (especially from an AI) as a **first draft**. Before you ask for a review, please take a moment to:
* Test the code to make sure it works.
* Refactor it to match our project's style.
* Make sure you are comfortable with *how* it works.

### Keeping Our Project & Community Safe

As a civic tech project, we have a deep commitment to protecting our community. This means keeping our project's data and our users' privacy safe is one of our highest priorities.

#### **Protecting User Privacy**
Public AI tools can store or even train on the data you provide. To protect our users, **please never paste real user data or any Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** into a public AI tool.
* **Strategy:** If you need to provide context, please use "dummy" or "anonymized" data (e.g., `user@example.com`, `Jane Doe`, `123 Main St`).

#### **Protecting Project Security**
Similarly, **please never paste secrets** (like API keys, passwords, or database credentials) into an AI prompt. These must stay confidential to keep our project secure.

AI models don't always write secure code. It's helpful to review any AI-generated code with an eye for security, especially if it handles user input.

### A Space for Learning

We are all here to learn. It's completely normal to feel stuck or confused, especially when an AI gives you code you don't understand. We want this to be a safe place to ask questions.

* **Ask for Help:** If you're struggling, please reach out in our chat! A 20-minute pairing session with a teammate is often the best way to get un-stuck and share knowledge.
* **Be Open:** Being open about using AI in your PR (e.g., "I used an AI to draft this function, and then I refactored it") gives your reviewer helpful context. It's not about judgment—it helps us all learn from each other's process.
